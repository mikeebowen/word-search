# Word Search Puzzle
​
Given a collection of letters which contain hidden words (in the file `WORDSEARCH.TXT`), find all of the words in the word list (in the file `WORDLIST.TXT`) within the puzzle.  Remember, the words may be hidden left to right, right to left, up, down or diagonally.
​
Create an application which will search the puzzle for the words contained in the list.  Your output should note which word you found, where you found it and one of the following designations for the direction the word takes:
​
Designation | Description
------------|------------
LR          | Left to right
RL          | Right to left
U           | Up
D           | Down
DUL         | Diagonal up left
DUR         | Diagonal up right
DDL         | Diagonal down left
DDR         | Diagonal down right
​
Your deliverable for this exercise will be the application and all supporting modules necessary to compile and run your solution.
​
There is no "right" solution to this problem. We are simply trying to determine how you approach the problem and the quality of the output you deliver.  Solid, well performing code always wins out over clever code.
